# Objective

The students should become familiar with *state-space* type realization structure
used for implementing IIR filters.

# Theoretical notions


# Exercises

1. Consider the IIR system with the system function
	$$H(z) = \frac{1 + 2z^{-1} + 3 z^{-2} + 2 z^{-3}}{1 + 0.9z^{-1} + 0.8 z^{-2} + 0.5 z^{-3}}$$
	
	a. Write the equations and draw the type I and type II state-space implementations of this system
    b. Compute the first 5 values of the step response, considering the initial conditions
	$v[0]=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 \\
	0 \\
	1
	\end{bmatrix}$

2. Consider the system with the following state-space equations:

	$$v[n+1] = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0     & 1 \\
	-0.81 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	v[n] + 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 \\
	1
	\end{bmatrix}
	x[n]
	$$
	$$y[n] = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
	- 1.81 & 1 
	\end{bmatrix}
	+ x[n]
	$$

	a. Find the system function of this system
	b. Compute the first 5 values of the step response, considering the initial conditions
	$v[0]=
	\begin{bmatrix}
	0 \\
	1
	\end{bmatrix}$
	c. Draw the the type I and type II state-space implementations of this system, as well as the direct form II implementation

	
1. In the Matlab environment, use the `fdatool` tool to design a stopband filter of order 4, elliptic type, 
with stop band between 1kHz and 3kHz, at a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz. Export the coefficients in the Matlab workspace
as the vectors `a` and `b`.
	
4. In the Matlab environment, implement a function `filter_spst(b, a, x)` which filters a signal `x` with
the filter defined by the coefficients `b` and `a`. Implementation shall follow the type I state-space equations.

5. Test the function written above with the coefficients designed at step 3, by filtering a sample audio signal.


6. Modify the function to perform temporal filtering of a video sequence, only for a filter of order 3.
   Test the function on the video sequence `veh_small.mp4`.

   To read frames from a video sequence in Matlab, you can use the following snippet:

   ```  
   v = VideoReader('videofile.mp4');

   % Read all the frames from the video, one frame at a time.

   while hasFrame(v)
    frame = readFrame(v);
	
	% Do the processing here
	
   end
   ```
