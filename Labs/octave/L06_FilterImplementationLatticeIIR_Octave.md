# Objective

The students should become familiar with *lattice*-type realization structure
used for implementing IIR filters

# Theoretical notions


# Exercises

1. Consider the causal IIR system with poles and zeros, with the system function:
$$H(z) = \frac{ 1 + 2z^{-1} + 3z^{-2} + 2z^{-3} }{ 1 + \frac{2}{5}z^{-1} + \frac{7}{20}z^{-2} + \frac{1}{2}z^{-3} } $$

	Find and draw the equivalent *lattice* structure for the IIR filter.

2. Consider the causal IIR system, with no zeros, with the following system function:
$$H(z) = \frac{1}{ 1 + \frac{2}{5}z^{-1} + \frac{7}{20}z^{-2} + \frac{1}{2}z^{-3} } $$
	
	Find and draw the equivalent *lattice* structure for the IIR filter.

	
3. Using the Octave software, use the `ellip() ` function to design one of the following elliptic IIR filters:
    
    a. A low-pass IIR filter of order 4, elliptic type, with cutoff frequency of 6kHz at a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz;
    a. A high-pass IIR filter of order 4, elliptic type, with cutoff frequency of 2.5kHz at a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz;
    a. A band-pass IIR filter of order 4, elliptic type, with passband between 0.5kHz and 5.5kHz at a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz.

4. **Not needed; function given.** Create an Octave function to `tf2latc_iir()` to compute the coefficients of the lattice form of an IIR filter, 
starting from the coefficients of the Transfer Function. 
    
    Call it like this: `[K, V] = tf2lact_iir(b, a)`
    
    Use it to convert the filter designed in the previous exercise.


5. Create an Octave function to filter an input signal `x` with an IIR filter in lattice form, given the coefficients $K$ and $V$:
    
    ```
    y = filter_latc_iir(K, V, x)
    ```

6. Use the function above to load and low-pass the audio signal `Kalimba.mp3`.

    a) Load the file using `audioread()`
    b) Filter the signal using `filter_latc_iir()`, with the previously designed filter
